Dimensionality Reduction & Stock Price Prediction
🚀 Machine Learning & Time Series Forecasting with Python 🚀
Overview
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) for stock price forecasting. The goal is to enhance visualization of high-dimensional data and predict future stock movements using historical market trends.
Features
✅ Dimensionality Reduction: Convert high-dimensional datasets into meaningful 2D representations using PCA.
✅ Stock Price Forecasting: Implement ARIMA to model and predict stock prices.
✅ Data Preprocessing: Convert timestamps, handle missing values, and create meaningful features.
✅ Visualization: Generate scatter plots for PCA and time-series plots for stock price trends.
✅ Error Analysis: Evaluate predictions using MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
Tech Stack
🔹 Python
🔹 Pandas & NumPy
🔹 Scikit-learn (PCA)
🔹 Statsmodels (ARIMA)
🔹 Matplotlib & Seaborn
